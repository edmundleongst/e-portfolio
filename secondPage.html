    <p>Introduction to Programming (First Modules)</p>
    <p><br>The first module that I most eagerly wanted to share is the subject of Introduction of Programming. As I'd mentioned before, I'm interested in programming mostly. It is also part of my ambitious to be something of it. In YPC International College, they have teached me this subject and it is teached by Ms. Noraniza Jaafar. This module teaches me Java at that time and I'd know that it is a strong and standalone programming language. It provides the features of portability and exception handling. Portability is supported by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JVM helps in compiling the source code into a standard and platform independent bytecodes. JVM is a program that is highly optimized on each specific platform which you run your Java code. This means that each platform has one JVM that is installed specific to that operating system. </p>

    <p>Another features of Java is that it has a class of Throwable. This class is used for exception conditions that the user program created should catch. This class is further divided into Exceptions and Error. The meaning of Exceptions is that it is a conditions which when running the application the application should try to catch while Error indicates a serious problem that the application cannot try to catch. One example of Exceptions is that when running the application if the result of one variable is not a number, application throws error and ask for data one more time. Another example of Error is that if a user have try to hack an application to steal the data inside. Application cannot try to catch this error from happening because it is unexpected and even if the application can a user can have more than one way to hack. In this situation, the primary concern when developing the application is to ensure that it can be run successfully rather than catch the user from hacking. </p>

    <p>In approaching the end of the semester, our school had demand us to build a computer seat booking system project. I have learned the basics of Java programming language that time. This helped me in doing the project. Although the materials provided in school is not sufficient to help me in building it, I have referred to outside resources in doing it. This in turn helped me in my personal learning. I have learned how to have a good and strong self-discipline, time management skills and others. I have also referred to the largest programmer's website Stack Overflow when questions raised. There are a lot of good and experienced programmer that is willing to answer my question. This in turned have helped to solved my problems and helped me in accomplishing the project.</p>

    <p><br>English (Second Modules)</p>
    <p><br>The second module that I wanted to share is the subject of English. This is because english is important in our college's study. In our college's study, all of our subjects are teached in english. This cannot compared to our secondary school where there is still an amount of subjects are teached in our country's language, Malay. My English is teached by Ms. Mahes in college. She have teached us some basics grammar rules such as nouns, verbs, preposition and conjunction. I have then realize that English have a lot of rules and vocabulary to follow when using it. There is an english assignment in that semester and I have used what I had learned from Ms. Mahes to accomplish it. The assignment asked about some basics grammar rules and there is one essay for us to write about our college life. Personally I felt that the assignment is not very hard for me since my english can considered as good. </p>

Include a brief overview (and what they cover) about any two modules/units of your choice.

For each unit, say what you have learned up to the point of getting your portfolio marked, and add a brief personal reflection (e.g. how you feel you are doing with the unit, whether any prior study has helped, how well you have applied yourself in terms of self-directed study, etc).-->
